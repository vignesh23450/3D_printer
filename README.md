# Custom 3D Printer with Marlin Firmware

Welcome to the repository for our custom 3D printer project using Marlin firmware! This README will guide you through the setup, configuration, and usage of the firmware.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a customized 3D printer experience using the Marlin firmware. We've tailored the firmware to suit the specific needs and features of our printer design.

## Features

- [List your printer's specific features and customizations here]

## Getting Started

To get started with our custom 3D printer firmware, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and tools according to the instructions provided in the Marlin repository.
3. Configure the firmware according to your printer's specifications. Refer to the Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files for customization options.
4. Compile the firmware using your preferred method (e.g., PlatformIO, Arduino IDE).
5. Upload the compiled firmware to your 3D printer's control board.

## Usage

Once the firmware is uploaded to your printer's control board, you can start using it to print your 3D models. Here are some basic usage instructions:

1. Power on your 3D printer.
2. Preheat the printer's hotend and heatbed to the desired temperatures.
3. Load your filament into the extruder.
4. Prepare your 3D model file using slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
5. Transfer the sliced G-code file to your printer (via SD card or USB connection).
6. Start the print job from the printer's control interface.
